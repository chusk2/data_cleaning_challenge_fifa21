The jupyter notebook with all the code is located in file 
[clean_dataset_fifa21.ipynb](https://github.com/chusk2/data_cleaning_challenge_fifa21/blob/ffd2ce9ca9d7da8edf3d2a60c234480a67b96f4f/clean_dataset_fifa21.ipynb)

There is also a csv file with the 
[clean dataset](https://github.com/chusk2/data_cleaning_challenge_fifa21/blob/ffd2ce9ca9d7da8edf3d2a60c234480a67b96f4f/clean_dataset_fifa21.csv)

The raw data were obtained from file `fifa21 raw data v2.csv` and the description of every variable in the dataset was processed and exported to a dsv fiel called `variable_description.csv`. 

# EDA of FIFA 2021 dataset
After the cleaning of the dataset, I've make an exploratory data analysis on the data. The purpose is to gain some insights from the study of data.
